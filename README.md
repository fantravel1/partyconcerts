## 🌍 Overview

**PartyConcerts.com** reframes concerts as **full nights**, not assigned seats.

This is not about:
- perfect sightlines  
- quiet listening  
- solo optimization  

This is about:
- crews  
- movement  
- singing  
- dancing  
- sweating  
- pregame → show → afterparty  

> **This isn’t a show. It’s a night.**

---

## 🎯 Core Reframe: Concerts Are Group Events

PartyConcerts treats concerts as social medicine.

The value isn’t the seat.
The value is the **shared moment**.

You don’t remember where you sat.
You remember **who you were with**.

## 🔥 The Party Index™ (Signature IP)

Every concert gets a **Party Score (1–100)**.

### Party Index Factors
- crowd energy  
- singalong density  
- danceability  
- artist engagement  
- venue layout  
- alcohol culture  
- afterparty ecosystem  
- “strangers become friends” factor  

People start asking:
> “Was it a 92-party night or a 65?”

This becomes the language of the site.
